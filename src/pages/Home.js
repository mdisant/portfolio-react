                        Can we decode the brain? Is the next doctor a computer? How does bias evolve in an algorithm? To what extent are models limited by their data? These are just a few of the many questions driving my everyday experience. I am working towards uncovering how humans are programmed to live, through immersing myself in the data. Every action we take is subconsciously calculated, and I believe in the power of technology to replicate this ability.

                        In my free time, you will find me digging through Baseball Reference, solving a New York Times Mini crossword, or reading about Black Swans. I gravitate towards contextual data and look for ways to build on it.

                        Look around and engage with my educational, professional, and personal projects. Provide feedback, challenge ideas, and bring forward new insights. Letâ€™s work together and code the future.
